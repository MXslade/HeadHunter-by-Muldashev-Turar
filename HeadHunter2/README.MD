<h3>HEADHUNTER BY MULDASHEV TURAR</h3>

<p>
    This project was created using .Net MVC Framework <br>
    As the framework suggests I have used MVC patterns to implement functionality<br>
    As the result we have the following funcionality:
    <ul>
        <li>Authentication (implemented by IdentityFramework)</li>
        <li>Registration (implemented by IdentityFramework)</li>
        <li>Admin panel for main CRUD operations</li>
        <li>Authenticated User can create and modify their CV</li>
        <li>
            User can add to the cv:
            <ul>
                <li>Title>
                <li>Description</li>
                <li>Salary</li>
                <li>City</li>
                <li>General Personal Information</li>
                <li>Can Modify his professional skills</li>
